# Branches Demystified

## Git branches might not be what you think they are

**The Main Branch**
A branch is just a reference to a commit
HEAD is just a reference to a branch

If you canâ€™t use git switch , then use git checkout instead

## Three Rules

The current branch tracks new commits
When you move to another commit, Git updates your working directory
Unreachable objects are garbage collected
